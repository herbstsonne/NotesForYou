# NotesForYou

Some time ago I had the idea that getting a personal relevant link in a note each day 
would be a nice way to get to know another person without sharing too much information in WhatsApp.
So I started to develop a little Xamarin app.
It offers the possibility to save links that can belong to different categories in a local database. 
It is possible to set a time when a note should be sent by a background service that contains a random database entry. 
After an entry was sent one can find it in a list that contains all already sent entries.

Currently it only works on Android.
